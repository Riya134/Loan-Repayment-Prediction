# Loan-Repayment-Prediction
Training a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be fully paid off or “charged off” (never fully paid).


In the lending industry, investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender profits from the interest earned. However, if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders face the problem of predicting the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan.

To address this problem, I used publicly available data from LendingClub.com, a website that connects borrowers and investors over the Internet. This dataset represents 9,578 3-year loans that were funded through the LendingClub.com platform between May 2007 and February 2010. The binary dependent variable not.fully.paid indicates that the borrower was not able to pay back in full (the borrower either defaulted or the loan was “charged off,” meaning the borrower was deemed unlikely to ever payback).

To predict this dependent variable, I used independent variables available to the investor when deciding whether to fund a loan.
